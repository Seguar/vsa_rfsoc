This collection of software in this folder and its subfolders allows the testing of the IQTools server.
It is intended to be used in a SCPI based fashion, via sockets.
The test types can be described in the file names ("IQServer_Test_Single_Pulse" will generate types of single pulses)

Notes:
1.This was developed in PyCharm, with Python 3.6.3
2.Launch an instance of the SCPI server before testing.
